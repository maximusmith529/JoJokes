# JoJokes: A console based RPG
This was a project that I began working on in my Sophomore year of highschool. 
It's an ASCII RPG similar to Adventureland and other IF games.
Currently it is discontinued, but I may revamp it into an actual text-based adventure RPG, similar to my senior projects.

I really loved it for how I tried to put everything I wanted from a game into it, if I had more time I would have definitely finished it.
